/**
 * This class represents a single blog entry. Instances of this class serve as
 * objects to the object-oriented tasks, such as Servlets, and also as entities
 * to the blog database. Concretely, this class represents a
 * <tt>blog_entries</tt> table in the database.
 * <p>
 * A single blog entry object contains the following information:
 * <ol>
 * <li>the entry ID, auto-generated on every object instantiation,
 * <li>a list of blog comments on the entry,
 * <li>date and time the entry was created at,
 * <li>date and time the entry was last modified at,
 * <li>title of the entry,
 * <li>text of the entry and
 * <li>a reference on the blog user that created the entry.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * All of the parameters above have corresponding getters and setters. String
 * constants in this class, which are represented by a <tt>VARCHAR</tt> when
 * stored in the database, have corresponding public static final fields
 * containing the length of <tt>VARCHAR</tt> that will be used by the database.
